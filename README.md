## GitHub workflow

1. Pull in new code from GitHub  

   * ```$ git pull```

2. Create new branch (or switch to new branch -- don't change 'master' branch)

   * ```$ git checkout -b <feature name>```

3. Code to your heart's content

   * ```$ git add .```
   * ```$ git commit -m "<commit message>"```
   * ```$ git push``` (will push to your own branch -- not master)
